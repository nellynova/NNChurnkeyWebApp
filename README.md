1. Instructions on how to run the code locally
   - Hi! Thank you for taking the time to review my assessment. Follow the steps below to review my code:
   - Prerequisites
      - Ensure you have Visual Studio installed (I created my ASP.NET Core Web App in Visual Studio 2022)
   - Steps to Run the Project
      - Open the solution file named ‘NNWebApplication.sln’ 
      - In Visual Studio, select the solution configuration (Debug/Release)
      - Press F5 or click the green "Start" button at the top to build and run the application
   - Navigating the Application
      - Home Page
         - Once the application is running, the home page should appear first
         - Here you can browse through the Top 10 TV Shows in the U.S. today, learn about us, or manage your account
      - Manage Account
         - To access the cancellation page, you can:
            - Click the “Manage Account” button either in the top navigation bar or next to the browse button
         - On the account management page, click the “Cancel Subscription” button to initiate the Churnkey Cancel Flow
           
3. Onboarding improvements I would make
   - Although the Quick Start Guide was very thorough and helpful, there are a few improvements I would consider:
      - In Step One, the instructions state that ‘YOUR_APP_ID’ can be found in “Your Account”; however, this ID is located in Settings within the “Cancel Flow API Keys” section. Although a small change, it would enhance the user experience if they are not familiar with their account yet.
     - In Step Three, there is a minor typo in the code section where the comma after ‘SUBSCRIPTION_ID’ is missing.
     - Including a video demonstration at the beginning of the guide can benefit users who prefer a visual overview before diving into the details. The video should also provide a brief summary of what will be covered and answer any common questions during the setup process.
      - As Churnkey grows, you may also consider implementing a chatbot to handle increased customer interactions and provide instant responses to inquiries.
